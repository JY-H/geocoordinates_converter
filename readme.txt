	This is a script written to collect latitude/longitude coordinates for Punchlistâ€™s data collection. 

	In order to use the script, please copy all the addresses for which you want the longtitude and latitude, into a single text file named "testing.txt" and put the text file in the same directory as the code. 

	I have included a sample "testing.txt" so you can match the address format (the street address, without city or zip code). 

	Then run scraper_tester.py and you will get two text files as your output: latitude.txt, longitude.txt. Simply copy those coordinates into the excel spreadsheet. 

Note: Python and appropriate package installations are necessary.
